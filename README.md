* **Normalized SQL Schema:** Includes `stores`, `products`, `inventory_data`, and `inventory_kpis` with composite primary keys and indexing.
* **ETL via SQL:** Bulk import from raw CSV, transformation into normalized tables, data validation, and KPI generation.
* **Analytics Layer:** Core SQL views like `vw_current_stock_levels`, `vw_reorder_analysis`, `vw_inventory_turnover`, `vw_abc_classification`, `vw_seasonal_analysis`.
* **Dashboard Reports:** Executive-focused summary views such as `vw_executive_kpi_dashboard`, `vw_stockout_risk`, and category/store performance metrics.
* **Live Visualization:** Real-time dashboard for key metrics and store-level insights.
